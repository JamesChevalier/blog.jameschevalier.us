* Jekyll + Foundation CSS *

I love Zurb's Foundation framework, and Jekyll is a great tool for preventing code duplication while building static HTML/CSS/js websites.

This tool really just exists to create a "base" directory for starting new projects.

It includes:
-all the directories that Jekyll needs to compile your static site
-the foundation framework (css/js/images)
-a default html5 template in _layouts
-a default nav bar under _includes
-orbit slideshow js code in _includes, ready to be called on any page
-default index and 404 page, along with 3 other empty pages

I hope this is useful to someone else as well, it has certainly made me more productive.

Cheers!
