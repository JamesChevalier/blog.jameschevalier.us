#This is the data for my blog

My blog design uses [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com). It's automatically built into a static site by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and deployed to [Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=4b85e2ea3c6b78b139cc41e341ae37fdac438c54) each time I push to [GitHub](http://github.com/).

Everything in `_site/` and `assets/attachments/` is mine.
