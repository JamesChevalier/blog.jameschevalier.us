#This is the data for my blog

My blog is designed with [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com). It's automatically built into a static site by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and deployed to [Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=4b85e2ea3c6b78b139cc41e341ae37fdac438c54) each time I `rake deploy`. I keep it in GitHub as another Jekyll example, and as a backup.

Everything in `_site/` and `assets/attachments/` is mine.
