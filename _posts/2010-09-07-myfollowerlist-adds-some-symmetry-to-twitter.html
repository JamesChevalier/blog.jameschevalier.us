<p>I've put together a Twitter service that adds some symmetry to Twitter by transforming your audience into a tweetstream.  With <a title="MyFollowerList" href="http://myfollowerlist.com" target="_blank">MyFollowerList</a>, you can more easily engage with the people following your tweets without crowding up your timeline.</p>

<p>Basically, MyFollowerList is a <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/attachments/theres-list-for-that.html">Twitter list</a> of the people that follow you on Twitter. The service automatically updates the list a few times daily, and applies some criteria to trim out people who haven't been active.  This way, your list always reflects the most relevant people that are listening to you right now.</p>

<p>To make a MyFollower list, just stop by the <a title="MyFollowerList" href="http://myfollowerlist.com" target="_blank">MyFollowerList</a> site &amp; click the link to authorize my service to access your Twitter account.  Once you click "approve", everything else is taken care of.</p>

<p>So go give it a shot - <a title="Allow MyFollowerList" href="http://myfollowerlist.com/redirect.php" target="_blank">allow MyFollowerList</a>, then let me know how you like it <a href="http://twitter.com/JamesChevalier">on Twitter</a>!</p>
