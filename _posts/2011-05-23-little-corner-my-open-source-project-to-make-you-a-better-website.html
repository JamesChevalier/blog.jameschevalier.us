<p>A while back, I ran across two really cool profile/hub/aggregate website providers: <a title="Flavors.me" href="http://flavors.me" target="_blank">Flavors.me</a> and <a title="About.me" href="http://about.me" target="_blank">About.me</a>.  I really liked the idea of the personal hub page, and the way that both sites accomplish the design.  So, for my recent website redesign I decided to push my blog over to <a title="James Chevalier's Blog" href="http://blog.jameschevalier.us" target="_blank">http://blog.jameschevalier.us</a> and use the base domain name as my own attempt to recreate what I saw Flavors &amp; About doing.</p>

<p>I've decided to call what came out of this idea <a title="Little Corner on GitHub" href="https://github.com/JamesChevalier/Little-Corner" target="_blank">Little Corner</a>.  The source code of this project is available at <a title="Little Corner on GitHub" href="https://github.com/JamesChevalier/Little-Corner" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, so you can even implement this for your own website.</p>

<p>I see this form of website as a more functional "business card" type website.  The main page is pretty simple, and static.  There are a few links which look like they'll bring the visitor off to other services, but what they're really doing is bringing the services into the site.  When a link is clicked, the right side of the page displays a translucent overlay on top of the full-screen background with the content of wherever that link would have gone to (<a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="http://foursquare.com" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>, <a title="Last.FM" href="http://last.fm" target="_blank">Last.FM</a>, etc) on top of that.</p>

<p>This has been a great opportunity to jump into a few <a title="Application programming interface" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">APIs</a>, as well.  Each of the external services that I'm pulling data from is pulling that data through the service's API.  This makes for a fairly typical experience with a site like Twitter, but allows for some really cool things to happen with the information from sites like Last.FM or Foursquare.</p>

<p>I've just barely started, so there's much more potential in what this <a title="Open source" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank">open source</a> project could be.  While I was creating the first version of this project, Foursquare released a new version of their API ... I started getting into the <a title="Twilio" href="http://twilio.com" target="_blank">Twilio</a> API ... And there's still so much customization to offer within the website itself!</p>

<p>You can see Little Corner in use on my own website <a title="James Chevalier" href="http://jameschevalier.us" target="_blank">right here</a>, and you can either download or contribute to the project <a title="Little Corner on GitHub" href="https://github.com/JamesChevalier/Little-Corner" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>
