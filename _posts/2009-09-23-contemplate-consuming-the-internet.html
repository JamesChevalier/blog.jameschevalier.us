<p>Don't waste time revisiting websites over &amp; over - have them delivered to you!  Subscribe to a site's <a title="What is RSS?" href="http://www.whatisrss.com/" target="_blank">RSS</a> feed (like <a title="James Chevalier's RSS Feed" href="/feed/" target="_blank">mine</a>), so you don't have to travel all over the internet to stay up to speed.  Instead of going from website to website reading them individually, you'll have the updates delivered to you in a single easy to manage location.</p>

<p>To do this, you'll need a feed reader - my reader of choice is <a title="Google Reader" href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>.  It allows you to do more than simply consume information - you get to share everything, and comment on it as well (you'll hear more on that in later posts).  There's also a mobile version of the site, so you can pick up where you left off - anywhere you go.</p>

<p>Here's a quick guide on how to subscribe to a site's RSS feed:
<ol>
	<li>Go sign up for an account to use <a title="Google Reader" href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a></li>
	<li>Visit a website; we'll use <a title="James Chevalier" href="http://blog.jameschevalier.us" target="_blank">my site</a> as an example</li>
	<li>In the address bar, click the RSS icon that looks like this <img title="RSS" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/attachments/RSS.jpg" alt="RSS" width="16" height="16" /></li>
	<li>Select the "RSS 2.0" entry from the menu that contains different "Subscribe to" options</li>
	<li>Click on the "Subscribe Now" button in the bland page you were taken to</li>
	<li>Click the "Add to Google Reader" button in Google's page which is asking how to subscribe</li>
</ol>
Now that you know what you're doing - go ahead and subscribe to all of your frequently visited sites...</p>

<p>After you subscribe to more &amp; more RSS feeds, you might find that you need to start organizing your collection.  Here's a screen shot of my freshly-read Google Reader screen (it doesn't happen often!), which consists of about 150 subscriptions sorted into about a dozen folders:</p>
