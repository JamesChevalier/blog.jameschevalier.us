<p>Noel wrote a post, <a href="http://noelstjean.tumblr.com/post/25441553620" title="'Is it really necessary?' and other (similar) questions" target="_blank">"Is it really necessary?" and other (similar) questions</a>, about parents of dance students always asking if the next class or event is required. The perspective struck me - that "Do I Have To?" response to an obligation - and it got me thinking about how people handle large goals...</p>

<p>For example, I often hear how others can't believe I keep running as much as I do. I'm training for a half marathon, so I'm running pretty frequently and setting personal bests on my mileage. Even so - I don't get the feeling that they think I run an <em>inhuman</em> distance, or that my schedule is completely <em>incomprehensible</em> to them. The feeling that I get, when I hear them congratulate me on my hard work in that manner, is that they think they wouldn't be able to keep themselves from slacking off while working towards the goal.</p>

<p>That they wouldn't be able to keep from asking themselves 'Do I have to?'.</p>

<p>That they wouldn't be able to tell themselves 'Yes.' each time they asked themselves 'Do I have to?'.</p>

<p>I was thinking earlier today, after my run, about how we spend the first two years of our lives figuring out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence" title="object permanence" target="_blank">object permanence</a> &amp; the rest of our lives trying to come to grips with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence" title="impermanence" target="_blank">impermanence</a>. Now, after reading Noel's post, I'm thinking about how so much that we observe/learn as children affects our behavior later in life. Maybe many of us figured out how to question the necessity of each of the individual steps that go into attaining a larger goal to such a debilitating extent that we prohibit ourselves from attaining our goals. And from the perspective of Noel's post, I wonder how many of us figured that out by watching our parents talk to our teachers.</p>

<p>You have a goal. You have the steps required to reach that goal. All of the steps are required.</p>
