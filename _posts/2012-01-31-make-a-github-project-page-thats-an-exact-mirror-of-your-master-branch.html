<p>GitHub has a <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Project Pages</a> feature that creates a webpage based on the content of the gh-pages branch of a repository. I asked, and subsequently answered, the question of how to get the Project Page to be an exact mirror of the Master branch over on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9069165/can-i-make-the-gh-pages-branch-of-my-git-repository-a-mirror-of-the-master-branc" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<p>One way I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1705224/github-how-to-include-files-from-master-in-new-git-branch-gh-pages" target="_blank">found</a> is to run the following command, which sets a configuration setting that causes every subsequent instance of <code>git push</code> to push the Master branch of the repository into the gh-pages branch:
<code>git config --add remote.origin.push +refs/heads/master:refs/heads/gh-pages</code></p>

<p>The trouble with this solution is that I'm using the <a href="http://mac.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Mac App</a>, which doesn't use a strict <code>git push</code>. According to <a href="http://mac.github.com/help.html" target="_blank">their Help page</a>, it does a <code>git pull --rebase</code>. Additionally, even when I select Push from the Repository menu, my git config line isn't adhered to. I'm not sure what's up with that...</p>

<p>I ran through a bunch of my own tests, trying to figure out how this branch mirroring can be done in a GitHub-For-Mac-App-Friendly way. It doesn't seem like you need to go through the exact process they've <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">described</a> to create the gh-pages branch. Over there, they provide the following process along with the disclaimer "Caution: make your working directory clean before you do this (either stash or commit), otherwise this will lose any changes you've made to your project since the last commit.":
{% highlight bash %}
cd /path/to/repo-name
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages
rm .git/index
git clean -fdx
echo "My GitHub Page" &gt; index.html
git add .
git commit -a -m "First pages commit"
git push origin gh-pages
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>Instead, you can simply create a new branch named gh-pages from within the GitHub Mac App. They probably don't instruct people to do this because what I'm accomplishing here isn't a typical scenario.</p>

<p>You can take these steps to create the 'gh-pages' branch from within the GitHub Mac App:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Branches view of your repository</li>
	<li>Click the + button on your Master branch to create a new branch - name this 'gh-pages'</li>
	<li>Click the Publish button to push it to GitHub</li>
	<li>Use the bottom left menu to checkout the Master branch, if you're not working in the Master branch</li>
</ol>

<p>Each time you want to update your Project Page, just run these steps to sync your Master branch into your gh-pages branch within the GitHub Mac App:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Switch to Branches view</li>
	<li>Click the Merge View button to display the Merge view</li>
	<li>Drag the Master branch to the left slot &amp; the gh-pages branch to the right slot</li>
	<li>Click the Merge Branches button</li>
	<li>Use the bottom left menu to checkout the gh-pages branch</li>
	<li>Click the Branch in Sync button to force a synchronization</li>
</ol>
