<p>It's fairly common that I'll have to look through dozens of files for particular lines of text.
Sometimes it's a set of log files that I need toÂ find every instance of a certain action in...
Sometimes it's a <a title="CodeIgniter" href="http://codeigniter.com/" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a> project that I need to find each instance of a function in...</p>

<p>In the past, I've used <a title="Grep on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep" target="_blank">grep</a> to do this. It allowed me to search an entire directory of files with one command, which was incredibly helpful. I still had to note the filenames that contained the search results, and open those files in an editor. After I was in the editor, I'd have to do another search to actually get to the text that I was looking for.

<p>Now, with <a title="BBEdit in the Mac App Store" href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=vwHUN9G4nyY&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=3909&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbbedit%2Fid404009241%3Fmt%3D12" target="_blank">BBEdit</a>, I do one Multi-File Search and click the search results that I want to inspect closer. This opens the file in the lower half of the window - just below the search results in the same window. The file is opened directly to the line I need, with the search result highlighted. It's not just a display of the file, either, it's a fully functioning editor.</p>

<p>Fast searching.<br />
Instant access.<br />
Complete context.<br />
In-search editing.</p>
