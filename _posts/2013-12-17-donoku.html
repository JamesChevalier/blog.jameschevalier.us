<p>I poked around at my first Sinatra project the other day: <a href="https://github.com/JamesChevalier/donoku">Donoku</a>.
It's a simple two-page site to take donations through <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-checkout">Checkout</a>. It's built to be deployed to <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> &amp; forces SSL, since Heroku gives its "appname.herokuapp.com" domains SSL access for free.</p>

<p>I've already used Donoku twice on my own! Once to accept donations for <a href="http://citystrides.com">CityStrides</a>, and once to accept donations for my <a href="http://jimforward6.com">campaign</a> to be Holyoke's Ward 6 City Councilor.</p>

<p>
  To force SSL, I used the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rack-ssl-enforcer">rack-ssl-enforcer</a> gem. It's really simple to use... Just add the gem to your Gemfile, then require it in your app.rb file &amp; add a single line to require SSL everywhere outside of localhost &amp; the test environment:<br />
  {% highlight ruby %}
  require 'rack/ssl-enforcer'
  use Rack::SslEnforcer, except_hosts: /127.0.0.1$/, :except_environments => 'test'
  {% endhighlight %}
  You can see it in action at the top of <a href="https://github.com/JamesChevalier/donoku/blob/master/app.rb">Donoku's app.rb file</a>.
</p>

<p>There's a little bit of a <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> integration, as well. After the donation goes through, people are directed to the 'thank you' page that includes a mailing list signup form. There's nothing crazy going on, but it works.</p>

<p>It's also one of my first attempts at using <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/minitest">MiniTest</a> instead of <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rspec">rspec</a>. I like it just fine, but the familiarity that I have with rspec keeps me moving faster & the abundence of rspec documentation online gets me un-stuck quicker. I'm glad I tried it, but I'll be sticking with rspec (and might even switch Donoku over at some point).</p>
