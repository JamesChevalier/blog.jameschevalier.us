<p>By viewing the log for your Rails app from within Console, you can quickly clear your view of the log between tests so that you don't have to sift through irrelevant data. Just use the <strong>Clear Display</strong> button before accessing the site. It's non-destructive, so navigating away from the log file &amp; then viewing it again will display the entire log file. You can also delete the log file right from Console to keep it from getting out of hand.</p>

<p>If you're using Pow, run these commands in the Terminal:
{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/Library/Logs/Pow/apps
ln -s /path/to/your/rails/app/log name-of-your-rails-app
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>Now you can view the logs in Console under the FILES section in ~/Library/Logs/Pow/apps/name-of-your-rails-app/development.log</p>

<p>If you're not using Pow (<a title="You're not using Pow?!" href="/thoughts/pow-makes-multi-site-rails-apps-easy/">you're not using Pow?!</a>), run these commands in the Terminal:
{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/Library/Logs
mkdir Rails
cd Rails
ln -s /path/to/your/rails/app/logs name-of-your-rails-app
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>Now you can view the logs in Console under the FILES section in ~/Library/Logs/Rails/name-of-your-rails-app/development.log</p>

<h5>Update:</h5>
<p>Mountain Lion removed the feature of Console being able to display symlinked folders. I've looked around for another way to add folders to Console, but I haven't found anything really useful yet.</p>

<p>The only fix I have at the moment is to âŒ˜-o within Console, navigate into the symlink in Pow's log folder, and open the development.log file. This will keep the file open in Console, at the bottom of the log list. It's a serious pain for anyone with multiple Rails apps, though, because then they're all listed in Console as 'development.log'.</p>
